**Project: Statistical Analysis of Drinking Water Quality – Dhule Taluka**

## **Overview**

This project presents a detailed statistical study of drinking water quality across **50 villages in Dhule Taluka**. Water samples were tested for three major quality parameters:

* **pH**
* **TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)**
* **Electrical Conductivity**

These parameters were compared against internationally accepted standards and **Bisleri bottled water** as a reference benchmark. The project demonstrates complete statistical workflow including data cleaning, descriptive analysis, distribution fitting, hypothesis testing, and visualization.

# **1. Raw Data Cleaning**

The raw dataset contained 50 observations (villages) with attributes:

* Temperature
* pH
* TDS
* Conductivity

### ✔ Cleaning Steps

* Removed extra spacing and inconsistent labels
* Checked for missing values (none found)
* Converted data types to numeric
* Validated ranges:

  * pH must be 0–14
  * TDS must be positive
  * Conductivity must be non-negative
* Identified outliers using Z-scores (high TDS values in Nagaon and Saundane)
* Standardized column names

### Example Clean Data Format:

```
Village, Temp_C, pH, TDS, Conductivity
Behed, 24, 7.5, 537, 573.8
Lamkani, 24, 7.4, 674, 481.6
...
```

#**2. Descriptive Statistics**

| Parameter        | Mean   | SD     | Variance | Min | Max |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | -------- | --- | --- |
| **pH**           | 7.426  | 0.217  | 0.047    | 6.8 | 7.8 |
| **TDS**          | 668.78 | 209.35 | 43825.69 | 316 | 991 |
| **Conductivity** | 634.59 | 158.25 | 25042.50 | 379 | 991 |

### Interpretation:

* pH is within WHO safe limits (6.5–8.5)
* TDS average (669 mg/L) **exceeds recommended WHO limit (500 mg/L)**
* Conductivity average suggests **high dissolved ion concentration**

# 📈 **3. Fitting Probability Distributions**

### ✔ **pH → Lognormal Distribution**

* Test statistic: **3.2575**
* Degrees of freedom: **5**
* p-value: **0.9686**
* ❗ **Do not reject the distribution**
* Conclusion: pH fits Lognormal Distribution well.

---

###**TDS → Gamma Distribution**

* Test statistic: **2.5394**
* Degrees of freedom: **4**
* p-value: **0.7248**
* ❗ **Do not reject**
* Conclusion: TDS follows Gamma distribution, typical for skewed environmental data.

---

### ✔ **Conductivity → Normal Distribution**

* Test statistic: **4.3558**
* Degrees of freedom: **5**
* p-value: **0.9988**
*  **Do not reject**
* Conclusion: Conductivity fits a Normal distribution.

#  **4. Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test)**

Comparing village averages to **Bisleri water sample values**:

| Parameter        | Bisleri Value | Village Mean | Z-Score | p-Value | Result                 |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| **pH**           | 7.1           | 7.426        | -0.16   | 0.879   | ✔ Same as Bisleri      |
| **TDS**          | 121.5         | 668.78       | 16.41   | <0.001  | ❌ Not equal to Bisleri |
| **Conductivity** | 42.86         | 634.59       | 12.40   | <0.001  | ❌ Not equal to Bisleri |

### Interpretation:

* pH levels are comparable to bottled water.
* TDS and Conductivity are **significantly higher**, indicating contamination or hard water.

#  **5. Data Visualization**

Recommended plots (available in scripts):

### ✔ Histogram + Distribution Fit

* pH (Lognormal fit)
* TDS (Gamma fit)
* Conductivity (Normal fit)

### ✔ Boxplots

* Detect outliers in TDS and Conductivity

### ✔ Village-wise Line Plots

* To observe spikes in TDS and conductivity

### ✔ Scatter Plots

* Conductivity vs TDS (high correlation expected)

---

#  **6. Results Summary**

### ✔ pH

* Safe range (mean = 7.426)
* No major deviation from Bisleri water

###  TDS

* Mean = **668.78 mg/L**, above WHO limit (500 mg/L)
* Several villages exceed **900 mg/L** (unsafe)

###  Conductivity

* Mean = **634.59 μS/cm**, high for potable water
* Indicates excessive dissolved salts

### 🔎 Worst-affected villages:

* Nagaon (TDS = 991)
* Saundane (TDS = 977)
* Laling (TDS = 947)

###  Final Conclusion

Dhule Taluka drinking water is **chemically unsafe** in many villages due to elevated TDS and conductivity levels. Compared to Bisleri water, the quality difference is **statistically significant**. Long-term consumption may increase risks for:

* Kidney issues
* Gastrointestinal problems
* Water hardness-related diseases
